YBI PROJECT
SERVO PREDICTION:
This project, developed as part of the YBI Internship, aims to create a predictive model for estimating the servo motor position based on various input features. The goal is to use regression techniques to accurately predict the position of a servo motor given specific inputs.

The Servo Prediction project aims to create a model to accurately estimate servo motor positions based on input features such as motor type, screw type, proportional gain, and derivative gain. Using the "Servo" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the project employs regression techniques for prediction. The data is preprocessed, and a Linear Regression model is built and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared. The implementation and results are documented in a Jupyter notebook/google colab. This project is part of the YBI Internship, and it demonstrates the application of machine learning to predictive modeling.
