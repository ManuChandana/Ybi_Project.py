# Ybi_Project.py
This my first Project as a part of ybi Internship which is a Servo Prediction
# Servo Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating the servo motor position based on various input features. This project aims to use regression techniques to accurately predict the position of a servo motor given specific inputs.

## Data Source
The data used for this project is the "Servo" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes features such as motor, screw, pgain, and vgain, and the target variable is the class corresponding to the servo position.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Servo-Prediction.git
    cd Servo-Prediction

2. Create a virtual environment:
bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:
bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Ensure the Servo dataset is available in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the step-by-step implementation:
bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Servo_Prediction.ipynb

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed to encode categorical variables and split into training and testing sets. The preprocessing script can be found in `src/data_preprocessing.py`.

## Modeling
A Linear Regression model is used for the prediction of servo motor positions. The modeling script can be found in `src/modeling.py`.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. The evaluation script can be found in `src/evaluation.py`.

## Example Prediction
Here's an example of predicting the servo motor position for new input features:
python
# Example input data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'motor': ['E'],
    'screw': ['E'],
    'pgain': [5],
    'vgain': [4]
})

# Encode and predict
new_data = pd.get_dummies(new_data, columns=['motor', 'screw'])
new_data = new_data.reindex(columns=X.columns, fill_value=0)
predicted_class = model.predict(new_data)
print(f'Predicted servo motor position: {predicted_class[0]}')
## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: X.XX
- **R-squared**: X.XX
